        <ul>
            <li id="Exercise">3.1</li>
            <ul>
                <li>a. Compare and contrast the purposes of Node.js and of Express.js.</li>
                <p>   - Node.js is a software platform for developing scalable web applications.</p>
                <p>   - Express is a framework that is a collection of libraries of Node.js.</p>
                <li>b. Explain the purpose of the package.json file.</li>
                <p>   - package.json is a document that manages project information and dependencies.</p>
            </ul>
            <li id="Exercise">3.2</li>
            <ul>
                <li>a. Explain the sense in which these files are "static".</li>
                <p>   - HTML, CSS, image, js, etc., which means that the contents are fixed without any change.</p>
                <li>b. Indicate whether the server continues to serve up the hello-world message and explain why this is the case.</li>
                <p>   - If you have a static folder setting when you access the website, you are first asked if there is an index file in that folder, which is index.html in our lab exercise. For that reason, since we set the index.html, the server does not continue to serve up the hello-world message.</p>
